# Question 1

The data comes from [Ultimate Tennis
Statistics](https://ultimatetennisstatistics.com/goatList){.uri}, a
website that stores updated info on every player currently playing on
the professional tour and the statistics of those who have played in the
past. Many of their datasets include rankings, performance, tournaments,
etc, but I chose the GOAT list because I can visualize all of these
categories in one dataset that define players holistically. I chose
tennis statistics because I started playing tennis when I was three
years old, played throughout middle school, and played for varsity
throughout high school. Tennis is my ultimate passion and when I grow up
I aspire to become a data scientist or analyst for the professional
tennis tour, and I feel this was my first chance to try extracting
statistics on my favorite players.

# Question 2

I imported the data into R by manually scraping the data into a google
spreadsheet, downloading it as a csv file, and then importing it into
RStudio with the read.csv function. When I first scraped the data, I had
to remove duplicate rows that were redundant for the dataset. Before I
analyzed the data, I had to convert the variables that start with a
digit into letters in order to make the categories look more
aesthetically pleasing. For this, I used the rename function on all of
the functions in the dataset using `rename().`I left the numbers in the
dataset as is because it was crucial to analyze the amount of points per
player in order to determine the player who performed the best.

```{r cars, echo = FALSE}

tennis_goat_data <- tennis_goat_data |>
  rename(
    rank_points = `Rank P`,
    tournament_points = `Tourn P`,
    achievement_points = `Ach P`,
    number_grand_slams = GS,
    titles_won = TF,
    additional_achievements = AF,
    masters_titles = M,
    overall_wins = O,
    major_events_won = BT,
    titles = `T`,
    weeks_at_number_one = `W@1`,
    win_percentage = `W%`,
    career_peak_elor_rating = Elo
  )

```

# Question 3

```{r, echo = FALSE}
subset_table <- tennis_goat_data |>
  select(
    Name, 
    number_grand_slams,
    weeks_at_number_one, 
    win_percentage, 
    rank_points,
    career_peak_elor_rating,
    major_events_won
  )

descriptive_table <- data.frame(
  Variable = c(
    "Name",
    "number_grand_slams",
    "weeks_at_number_one",
    "win_percentage",
    "rank_points",
    "career_peak_elor_rating",
    "major_events_won"
  ),
  Type = sapply(subset_table, class),
  Description = c(
    "Player's name",
    "Total number of Grand Slam titles won by the player",
    "Total weeks the player has had the world number one ranking",
    "Player's overall win percentage",
    "Total ranking points of the player",
    "Player highest elor rating",
    "Amount of Major Events Won"
  )
)

kable(descriptive_table, col.names = c("Variable", "Type", "Description"))
```

# Question 4

### First Univariate Analyses

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Univariate histogram to display the frequency of grand slams amongst all the players in the dataset
ggplot(tennis_goat_data, aes(x = number_grand_slams)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill  = "blue", color = "black") + 
  labs(title = "Grand Slam Titles Distribution", x = "Number of Grand Slams", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

summary(tennis_goat_data$number_grand_slams)
```

This data is skewed right with a mean of approximately 1.233, a minimum
of 0, and a maximum of 24. As shown, most players tend to have 0 -5
grand slams. After that, the top 1% of players including Rafael Nadal,
Novak Djokovic, and Roger Federer have attained many grand slams despite
the odds.

### Second Univariate Analyses

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Univariate histogram to display the frequency of weeks at number one amongst all the players in the dataset
ggplot(tennis_goat_data, aes(x = weeks_at_number_one)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 40, fill = "lightgreen", color = "black") + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of Weeks at Number One", x = "Weeks at Number One", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

summary(tennis_goat_data$weeks_at_number_one)
```

As displayed in the histogram, a majority of the players in the tennis
dataset have 0 weeks at number one, and only a select amount have more
than 0. The data is skewed right, has a mean of 16.09, a minimum of 0,
and a maximum of 404 according to the summary statistics
`summary(tennis_goat_data$weeks_at_number_one)`. Novak Djokovic, listed
as number one on the GOAT rankings according to the dataset, had the
most amount of weeks and this is largely considered a factor of impact
on the game.

### Third Univariate Analyses

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Univariate histogram to display the frequency of the win percentage amongst all the players in the dataset
tennis_goat_data$win_percentage <- as.numeric(gsub("%", "", tennis_goat_data$win_percentage))

ggplot(tennis_goat_data, aes(x = win_percentage)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "orange", color = "black") + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of Win Percentage", x = "Win Percentage", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()


summary(tennis_goat_data$win_percentage)
```

As displayed in the histogram above and the program
`summary(tennis_goat_data$win_percentage)`, the graph has a mean around
63, a minimum of 49.20, and 83.80. The players with the highest
percentages are usually considered the greatest of all time(GOAT),
because they are achieving the most amount of victories.

### Fourth Univariate Analyses

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Univariate histogram to display the frequency of rank amongst all the players in the dataset
ggplot(tennis_goat_data, aes(x = rank_points)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "coral", color = "black") + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of Rank Points", x = "Rank Points", y = "Frequency") + theme_minimal()

summary(tennis_goat_data$rank_points)
```

The distribution of rank points which is skewed right display that the
frequency of players with fewer rank points is very high, specifically
around the 0-30 range, and there are far fewer players that have a lot
of rank points (above 100). Through the calculation of
`summary(tennis_goat_data$rank_points)`, we can see that the mean rank
points is around 15.

# Question 5

### First Bivariate Analyses

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Scatterplot for numerical values of number of grand slams compared to the rank points of the players 
ggplot(tennis_goat_data, aes(x = number_grand_slams, y = rank_points)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.7) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") + 
  labs(title = "Number of Grand Slams vs Rank Points", 
       x = "Number of Grand Slams",
       y = "Rank Points") +
  theme_minimal()

#Displays the correlation coefficient between the two variables
cor(tennis_goat_data$number_grand_slams, tennis_goat_data$rank_points)
```

For this scatterplot displaying the relationship between the number of
grand slams and total rank points, there is a strong, linear positive
correlation between the two variables because of a correlation
coefficient of 0.95.
`cor(tennis_goat_data$number_grand_slams, tennis_goat_data$rank_points)`
was the code I used to generate this number. As seen, players with more
grand slams tend to have higher rank points.

### Second Bivariate Analyses

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Scatterplot for numerical values of weeks at number one vs win percentage of the players
ggplot(tennis_goat_data, aes(x = weeks_at_number_one, y = win_percentage)) + 
  geom_point(color = "brown", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Weeks at Number one vs Win Percentage",
       x = "Weeks at Number One",
       y = "Win Percentage") +
  theme_minimal()

#Displays the correlation coefficient between the two variables
cor(tennis_goat_data$weeks_at_number_one, tennis_goat_data$win_percentage)
```

This scatterplot displays the relationship between the weeks at number
one and according win percentage of the players, and there is a
moderately, positive linear relationship between the variables because
of a correlation coefficient of 0.615. The
function`cor(tennis_goat_data$weeks_at_number_one, tennis_goat_data$win_percentage)`
was utilized to generate this number, and this shows that players who
were the longest at the number one rank usually have higher win
percentages.

### Third Bivariate Analyses

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Boxplot for Win Percentage by Number of Grand Slams
ggplot(tennis_goat_data, aes(x = factor(number_grand_slams), y = win_percentage)) + geom_boxplot(fill = "orange", color = "purple") + 
  labs(title = "Win Percentage by Number of Grand Slams",
       x = "Number of Grand Slams",
       y = "Win Percentage") +
  theme_minimal()

#Displays the summary statistics by group
aggregate(tennis_goat_data$win_percentage, by = list(tennis_goat_data$number_grand_slams), FUN = median)
```

This boxplot that displays the relationship between the win percentage
of the players by number of grand slams shows that players with a higher
number of slams have higher win percentages. The purple lines indicate
the median value per group of player grand slams, and the median win
percentage increases alongside the number of grand slams. There are
definetely less values towards the peak number of grand slams, and the
players who are in that range of values are in the GOAT debate. The
method`aggregate(tennis_goat_data$win_percentage, by = list(tennis_goat_data$number_grand_slams), FUN = median)`
was used to display the summary median values of all the groups of
number of grand slams.

### Fourth Bivariate Analyses

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Scatterplot for Weeks at Number One
top_players <- tennis_goat_data |>
  arrange(desc(career_peak_elor_rating)) |>
  slice_head(n = 10)

ggplot(top_players, aes(x = reorder(Name, career_peak_elor_rating), y = career_peak_elor_rating)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue", color = "brown") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(title = "Top 10 Players by Career Peak Elo Rating",
       x = "Player Name",
       y = "Career Peak Elo Rating") +
  theme_minimal()

# Displays the correlation coefficient between the two variables
player_elo_stats <- tennis_goat_data |>
  summarise(
    mean_elo = mean(career_peak_elor_rating),
    median_elo = median(career_peak_elor_rating),
    sd_elo = sd(career_peak_elor_rating),
    min_elo = min(career_peak_elor_rating),
    max_elo = max(career_peak_elor_rating)
  )
knitr::kable(player_elo_stats, 
             caption = "Summary Statistics for Career Peak Elo Ratings", 
             format = "markdown", 
             align = c("c", "c"))


```

This barplot displays the top 10 players of all the players by their Elo
rating, which is essentially tracks a player rating that will increase
more if they win against higher-rated opponents and less if they win
against lower-rated opponents.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
multi_plot <- ggplot(tennis_goat_data, aes(x = weeks_at_number_one, y = major_events_won, color = win_percentage)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Weeks at Number One, The Major Events Won, and overall Win Percentage",
    x = "Weeks at Number One",
    y = "Major Events Won",
    color = "Win Percentage"
  ) +
    theme_minimal()
  print(multi_plot)
```

According to the graph, there is a positive correlation between players
who have spent more weeks at number one and the amount of major events
they have won like ATP 500's, Master's, and Futures tournaments. Also,
players with higher win percentagges tend to cluster in the upper right
area, indicating that a higher dominance at the number one spot usually
means high win records and achievements.

## Parsing Variable of Interest

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tennis_goat_data$first_name <- sub(" .*", "", tennis_goat_data$Name)

# View the updated dataset
head(tennis_goat_data$first_name)
```

## Create at Least Two New Variables of Interest

### Mentions the category of the winning rate

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tennis_goat_data <- tennis_goat_data |>
  mutate(rate_of_winning = case_when(
    win_percentage >= 0.75 ~ "High Win Rate",
    win_percentage >= 0.50 & win_percentage < 0.75 ~ "Medium win Rate",
    win_percentage < 0.50 ~ "Low Win Rate",
    TRUE ~ "Unknown"
  ))

head(tennis_goat_data$rate_of_winning)
```

Here, I coded a new variable called 'rate_of_winning' that categorizes
each player into a high win rate, a medium win rate, and a low win rate
by their overall win percentage. Displayed above are the first few
values of the top few players.

### Adds up all points per player

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tennis_goat_data <- tennis_goat_data |> 
  mutate(total_achievement_score = rank_points + achievement_points + tournament_points)

# Shows the first few lines of the new variable created
head(tennis_goat_data$total_achievement_score)



```

Here, I coded a new variable of interest by adding up all the points
categories including rank points, achievement points, and tournament
points. Displayed above are the first few values of the first few top
players. Clearly, the points are displayed in decreasing order.

# Question 7

There are various elements out of the list provided that I decided to
utilize, and they all helped in making my report of the tennis GOAT
dataset look aeshetically pleasing. For part C, I reshaped the dataset
variable 'Name' to the top 10 players in order to capture the main
essence of the project: greatest tennis players of all time. I filtered
using arrange and utilized the slice function in the last barplot from
question 5 that depicted the Top 10 Players by Career Peak Elo Rating.
In addition to, for part A, I used 5 in-line codes within my report, and
they are scattered throughout my code or graph descriptions from
questions 4 and 5. Also, I did Part I by creating a multivariate plot of
the variables weeks at number one, major events won, and win percentage.
For Part G, I parsed the strings of the player names and retrieved only
the first names of the players into a new variable. For Part D, I
created two new variables of interests - one that mentions the category
of the player winning rate and another that adds up all the points per
player.

# Question 8

In the analysis of the tennis GOAT data, I explored the relationships
among key variables including the number of grand slams, weeks
atlibrary(readr)
Tennis_Greatest_of_All_Time_Spreadsheet_Statistics_Sheet1_1\_ \<-
read_csv("SDS 313/Tennis Greatest of All Time Spreadsheet Statistics -
Sheet1 (1).csv")
View(Tennis_Greatest_of_All_Time_Spreadsheet_Statistics_Sheet1_1\_)
number one, win percentage, rank points, and career peak Elo rating.
Overall, I found that players with more grand slams had higher winniung
percentages, and this makes sense since winning major tournaments
correlates with strong, consistent performance. Also, there was a clear,
positive relationship between weeks at number one and the number of
major events won, showcasing that players who spend more time as the
world's top-ranked player tends to have more high value achievements.
The data also displayed information about a player's Elo rating, a point
system that determines their overall ranking in the long run. The trend
amongst all the graphs show that the higher the independent variable,
the more the dependent variable or the measure of success on the GOAT
ranks. Similarly, as someone who was number one on my high school
varsity team, I know that being number one increased my reputation
amongst the entire district, and winning more matches against higher
rated opponents led to a boost in my rating and winning percentage
overall. All of these findings in this project make sense and they were
what I originally hypothesized.
